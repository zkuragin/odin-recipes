    <h3>The famous manti</h3>
    <p>
        Manti is an extraordinary dish from Kazakhstan: tiny lamb-stuffed dumplings topped with sauces.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you're served extremely small manti, your host thinks very highly of you - apparently the smaller the manti, the more special you are.
